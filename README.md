## My process

Started from the out in, building and desing the background elements. First made the body document background color according to specs. Then added a container to shape and solor the white background element. From there I used flex with some adjustments to position each section(div) of the design as close as I could according to the desing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Tried to used flexbox to make all adjustments with out adding minor positioning elements, but would not adhere to the design template. Was mostly worried about having to make huge adjustments for responsive modile design. Know there is a way with less code than I used. Still learning.

### Continued development

master flex and grid as to not have to add minor positioning elements such as padding and margin for responsive design.
